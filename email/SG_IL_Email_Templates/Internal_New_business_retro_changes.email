Thanks for reaching out to the Small Group Account Management team on this issue. Generally, we are able to assist on matters like this. In this case, unfortunately, we cannot assist on an exception for a retroactive change, back to the original effective date. Due to limitations to the new business systems, pertinent paperwork and knowledge of correspondence that may have taken place on the case, it is preferred that the Sales team work with the UW to obtain an exception back to inception. If the group decides they are willing to accept a future effective date, we are more than happy to assist them with the options available.
