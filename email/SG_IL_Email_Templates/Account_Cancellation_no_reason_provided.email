Hello,

We are in receipt of our mutual clients request to cancel their Small Group policy with BCBSIL.  We take pride in our partnership and after 80 years we have not forgotten that our customer is the reason we are in business.  In order to continue our excellent Customer Service, we ask for feedback as to the reason behind their decision, (no longer offering insurance, rates, moved out of state ect).  

Please let us know if you have any questions.
