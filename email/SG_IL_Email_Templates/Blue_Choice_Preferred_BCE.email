Hello,

Our Blue Choice Preferred plan is a PPO product using what is known as our Smart Network. When members utilize an in-network provider, they obtain the highest benefit level.    

When a member travels outside of Illinois, a member has access to Blue Card.  To locate a Blue Card Provider, call (800) 810-BLUE (2583) or at www.bcbsil.com under the provider finder; then select the state from the "I'm looking for a provider and I live in" drop down box, then choose Participating Provider Option (PPO) as the network choice.

Keep in mind that non Blue Choice Preferred Providers within Illinois and Providers in states that border Illinois bill Blue Cross of Illinois for services.  Therefore, claims submitted for non- emergent services would be reviewed under the out of network benefits and member could be balance billed by the provider.  Providers in states not bordering Illinois submit claims to their host plan and these claim would be reviewed under the in network benefit. 

Thank you,
