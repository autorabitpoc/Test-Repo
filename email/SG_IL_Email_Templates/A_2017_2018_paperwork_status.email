Hello,

We are in receipt of your request for {!Case.Group_Account_Number__c} paperwork status.  Please know that our processing team is working diligently to complete.  In the meantime, any members with an ID card for this account, may continue to utilize it. 

Should you have any new enrollees in need of immediate services or high dollar RX that needs to be filled, we ask that you provide the enrollment form, date of service, name and phone number of provider.  We will ask that a member of our Concierge team reach out to the provider with an update. 

Thank you,
