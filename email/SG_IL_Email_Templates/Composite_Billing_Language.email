Hello, 

Quoting of AD change composite rates: to ensure a match between the quoted rates and finalized rates, the census cannot include speculative members (those that may take the coverage). The quote census should only include actual currently enrolled members  (employees/spouses/dependents). 


Member terms & adds that occur between the quote date and implementation of the AD composite rates will affect the finalized rates. Variations in the members' dates of birth can also affect the finalized rates so accuracy is essential.

Thank you,
