Hello,

Thank you for your interest in applying for a Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois Small Group policy.  Due to the complex nature of employee benefits, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois requires that employers utilize the services of a licensed insurance broker in obtaining a group health, dental or life insurance policy. An insurance broker is an independent third-party adviser who can assist you with your insurance needs, often at no additional cost to the employer.  Attached is a list of brokers that would be more than happy to assist you in making a decision.
