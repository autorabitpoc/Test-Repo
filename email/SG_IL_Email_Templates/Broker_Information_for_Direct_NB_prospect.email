Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your 2018 health care options.  

Due to the complex nature of employee benefits, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois requires that employers utilize the services of a licensed insurance broker in obtaining a group health, dental or life insurance policy. An insurance broker is an independent third-party advisor who can assist you with your insurance needs, often at no additional cost to the employer. Attached is a list of brokers available to assist you in making a decision.  

We look forwarded to continuing our partnership in the upcoming year. 

Thank you,
