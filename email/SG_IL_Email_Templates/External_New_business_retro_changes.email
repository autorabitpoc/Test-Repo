Thank you for reaching out to the Small Group Account Management team on this issue. Generally, we are able to assist on matters like this. However, in this case, we will be asking your Sales Executive to contact you, since they have more background information on the initial setup. If the group is interested in a future effective date, we are more than happy to assist with the options available. Do not hesitate to reach out with any questions. 

Thank you and have a nice day.
