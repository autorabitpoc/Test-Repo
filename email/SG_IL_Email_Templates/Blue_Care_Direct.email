Hello, 

It is recommended that a member elect a PCP as some Specialists require prior to Consultation. 

Members are able to self-refer for many specialists for a Consultation (Neurologist, Physical Therapy and some others require pre-testing and will require a referral prior to the first visit).  

Member questions on how to elect a PCP, what requires a referral and what does not and where they can be seen outside of the locations listed on the provider finder would be guided by Advocate Customer Service directly.  The Blue Cross member phone number is (847) 298-6000 - Option 1 is for member services, Option 2 is for referral and other questions.

Thank you
