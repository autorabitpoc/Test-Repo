Hello, 

Blue Options (BCO) Cross Accumulating Deductible and Out-Of-Pocket

When choosing the Blue Options plan, there are three tier option choices under this product.  In order for members living in Illinois to obtain the highest level of benefits, they would utilize Tier 1 (BCO) provider.  They still have the option of using the National PPO but they will have higher out of pocket expenses and co-payment amounts.  Tier 3 is out of network.

Tier 1- the member pays the least out-of-pocket costs by choosing a Tier 1 (BCO) provider
Tier 2 - the member pays additional out-of-pocket costs by choosing a participating provider in the PPO (National Network) of providers
Tier 3 - the member pays the highest out-of-pocket as these are out of network providers. They would likely be required to pay up front for services 

Deductible and Out of Pocket cross accumulate (cross feed) which means deductible or out of pocket expenses met on the Tier 1 (BCO) network feeds into the Tier 2 PPO deductible and out-of-pocket expense buckets.  If a member utilized a provider in PPO network, deductible and out of pocket will feed into the Tier 1 (BCO) deductible and out-of-pocket expense buckets.


Traveling or Residing out of state

Member traveling or residing out of state would use a PPO (National Network) provider under the Blue Card program.  As a member traveling or living out of state does not have the option to use a Tier 1 (BCO) local provider.  Benefits will be paid at the Tier 1 level as long as they use providers that are contracted under the PPO (Larger Broad) network and the service is a covered benefit of their policy.  All levels of care - Non Emergent, Emergency and Urgent.

Members traveling or residing outside of Illinois may access Blue Card Providers by calling (800) 810-BLUE (2583) or at www.bcbsil.com under the provider finder; then select the state from the "I'm looking for a provider and I live in" drop down box, then choose Participating  Provider Option (PPO) as the network choice.
