Congratulations on your new case. 

We have submitted your BOR request to the Producer Service Center for processing. In the future, the most efficient way to submit would be via the producer portal, instructions can be found on page 10 of the attached quick start guide (click on Producer Services followed by the link "updating my producer of record (POR)". 

Should you not have access to the portal, please submit directly to producer_service_center@hcsc.net for processing. Once you have received notification of completion, you will gain access to the account on the BAE portal and ILSGAM will be able to begin assisting you. 

Any questions regarding the processing of BOR's, please contact PSC at (855) 782-4272 press 3 then 5.
