Good afternoon - 

As part of our regulatory requirements, I have attached a "Small Employer Stop Loss Disclosure" notice that must be provided to your group, as you are covered under a self-funded, Blue Balance Funded plan. 

The notice simply provides information regarding your stop-loss coverage. It does not affect the self-funded coverage that you have in place, today.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact your Producer or the Small Group Account Management Team. 

Thank you,
