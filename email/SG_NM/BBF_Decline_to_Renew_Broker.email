Dear [BROKER NAME]: 

Due to [group size/claims experience/risk score/delinquencies in payment}, your client, {!Case.Account} has been declined to renew in a Blue Balance Funded plan design for the upcoming year.  

To remain covered through a fully insured plan, please quote your client through our eSales tool to review fully insured options. As a reminder, paperwork for a fully insured plan must be received at least 30 days prior to the groupâ€™s renewal date.

Feel free to reach out to me or any other member of the Small Group Account Management Team with questions.

Thank you,
