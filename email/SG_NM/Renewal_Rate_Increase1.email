Hello [Name - THIS NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED],

While Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico works hard to help control health care costs – such as promoting generic prescriptions and using tools such as the Benefits Value Advisor – rates for the small group market segment are driven primarily by the underlying costs of providing medical care, including increases in medical services and how often these services are used. In setting rates, insurers project the expected cost of medical claims based on current cost trends.

A good example of this comes from recent news headlines, regarding the rise of prescription drug costs. Like other insurers across the country, our rates had to be adjusted, in part, to meet this trend.

When discussing rate increases, it is also important to remember that insurers have consumer protections, like Medical Loss Ratio requirements, in place to ensure that a minimum of 80 percent of every premium dollar must go toward medical costs each year. If this loss ratio isn’t met, premium rebates could be available. 

Thank you,
