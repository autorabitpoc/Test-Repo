We have identified an internal calculation issue that resulted in your receipt of a December renewal exhibit for your client which contained incorrect census information. That incorrect renewal was sent to you on August 28, 2017. Subsequently, a corrected renewal exhibit was sent to you. These impacted customers, with December effective dates, have not yet received their renewal. Now that we have provided you with the correct renewal, we will be sending those correct rates to the groups in compliance with timely notification requirements. 

We recognize that this causes confusion for you and your customers. We will not be able to support requests to hold incorrect rates from the first renewal exhibit sent to you. We will be required to adhere to the rating methodologies in place, requiring use of the correct census data. If you need additional time to reconvene with your customer and submit plan change paperwork beyond the standard paperwork due date, please contact us and we will accommodate that additional time.
