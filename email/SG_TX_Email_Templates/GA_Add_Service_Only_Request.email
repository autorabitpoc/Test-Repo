Producer Services,

This group was initially submitted as a "Direct" Group, no GA. However, the Broker is requesting to add a GA (name and tax ID # for the GA), for servicing only.

Please add the GA and instruct Bluestar not to check the Paid GA Box.  The GA should not be paid any overrides.

Thanks for your  help.
