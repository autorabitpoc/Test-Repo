Thank you for your interest in a Blue Balance Funded Quote.  

To get started, please provide the employer contributions for the plans and
the total number of eligible employees enrolled and total waiving coverage 

As you may be aware, a minimum of 75% participation and 50% contribution is required for an Blue Balance Funded ASO quote. 

I will request a quote from underwriting upon confirming above information.

Please note: the quote must be requested at least 45 days prior to the effective date and must have had Blue Cross Coverage for at least 12 months (1st year groups can request ASO quote at their renewal)

Let me know if you have any questions. Thank you!
