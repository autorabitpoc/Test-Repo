Hello (   ),

Due to our system error, the group's (3/1/17) renewal was not sent to the group or you timely. To rectify our oversight, if the group doesn't make a plan change at renewal or the following two months, we will  issue a premium credit for all members captured in the group's renewal census for the months of (March, April, and May). Please be advised if the group adds new employees/dependents they will be subjected to the (3/1/17) renewal rates. 

Please let me know if the group anticipates making any plan changes.
