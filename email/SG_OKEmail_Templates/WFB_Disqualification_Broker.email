Dear [ ],

Recently, the 2018 Employee Group Size Certification Questionnaire was submitted for <GROUP> who is currently enrolled in a Work Force Blue plan. 

Based on the submitted answers, the group no longer qualifies for Work Force Blue based on participation or contribution requirements. If you believe this is an error, please reply back to this email with a revised form ASAP.

Otherwise, the group will need to select a new, metallic plan offered in their renewal exhibit and return a completed Benefit Program Application for Amendment. If this Amendment is not returned, their coverage will be cancelled. 

If you have any questions feel free to call us at 800-722-4890.
