I am sorry to hear that your group wants to leave Blue Cross!

Before I submit this request - I'd like to do what I can to help keep you with us. Did you know that you could be saving money on your medical coverage by changing your group's Anniversary Date? 

We actually have LOWERED our RATES for the third quarter, in 2018 - I'm more than happy to talk with you about how simple an Anniversary Date change can be and how it can save you and your group money!

I’d love to talk with you about ways to stay Blue – looking forward to the chance to do so!

Sincerely,
