Dear [GROUP LEADER]: 

Due to your [group size/claims experience/risk score/delinquencies in payment], your group has been declined to renew in a Blue Balance Funded plan design for the upcoming year. But, don't worry, there are still many affordable coverage options available through our fully insured plans!

To remain covered through a fully insured plan, please contact your producer to discuss your options. As a reminder, paperwork for renewal in to a fully insured plan must be received at least 15 days prior to the your renewal date.

I'm happy to work with you and your broker to discuss renewal options and help answer any questions you may have. 

Thank you,
