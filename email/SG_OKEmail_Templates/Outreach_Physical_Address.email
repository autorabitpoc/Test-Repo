Dear Group Administrator;

Every year Blue Cross Blue Shield sends out pertinent information related to your group health plan.  In order to do, so we require a physical address.  We have made an attempt to reach you by phone to obtain this information with no success.  Please reply to this email with the physical address of the company so that we may update our records.
 
We appreciate your business and willingness to assist in this matter.

Thank you for your help,
