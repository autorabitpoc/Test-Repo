Hello - 

According to our records, your BCBSOK group health coverage will be cancelling soon. As a member of your Small Group Account Management Team, it's my job to make sure you remain protected and any claims continue to be covered.

Can I ask that you simply reply to this email, identifying your intent to either cancel your group's coverage OR make a payment? 

Thanks in advance for your reply,
