Dear Group Administrator,

BCBSOK shows your group {!Case.Group_Account_Number__c} - {!Case.Account} as offering a benefit plan that has no enrollment.  We are unable to keep zero member plans open, and will be cancelling this plan.

Should you wish to add a plan for your employees, please ask your broker to submit a new group rates request directly to us.

Thank you for allowing us to serve you.
