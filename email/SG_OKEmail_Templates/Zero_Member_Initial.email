Dear Producer,

We show that your group {!Case.Group_Account_Number__c} - {!Case.Account} offers a benefit plan that has no members.  While we are unable to keep zero member plans open, I wanted to take a moment to make sure that there are no new members being added to the group in the upcoming days/months.

If the group has no plans to add any membership, I will move forward with the cancellation.

In the future, if this group would like to come back to us as a new group, you can always pull rates through our e-Sales tool. 

Thank you for allowing us to serve you.
