I am sorry to hear that {!Contact.Account__c} wants to leave Blue Cross!

Before I submit this request - I'd like to do what I can to help keep {!Contact.Account__c} with us. 

Would you be interested in talking about an Anniversary Date change? Believe it or not - we actually have LOWER rates for third quarter - and your client could take advantage of those savings by performing an Anniversary Date change. 

I’d love to talk with you about ways to stay Blue – looking forward to the chance to do so!

Sincerely,
